# Shopify steps
//need partner program
1. Create the app - npm run dev — —reset
2. Setup protected permissions
3. Update the app with the new urls. (OR just hardcode urls to mywavia urls). - No requirement for this step if using valmi.io
4. Take the client_api_key & run docker container & deploy the app on valmi UI — all you need is the CLIENT API KEY

5. For opensource users, Pull & Host the docker container && Ask to update urls in the app.
