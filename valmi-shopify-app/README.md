# Shopify steps
//need partner program
1. Create the app -
   # npm run dev — —reset (create a new app)
3. Setup protected permissions
   # partner dashboard and set to custom distribution
   # npm run dev (preview the store)
5. Update the app with the new urls. (OR just hardcode urls to mywavia urls). - No requirement for this step if using valmi.io
6.  # npm run shopify show env
7.  Take the client_api_key & run docker container & deploy the app on valmi UI — all you need is the CLIENT API KEY

8. For opensource users, Pull & Host the docker container && Ask to update urls in the app.
